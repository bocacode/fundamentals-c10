// I. Variables

// Variables are named "containers" that can hold a value.

const firstName = "Todd";

// These can be used to hold Strings (like above), Numbers, or Booleans (true/false).
// (They can also hold more advanced structures like Objects, Arrays, and even Functions.
//  We'll see these in a bit...)

const age = 47;
const subTotal = 98.79;

const payingWithCreditCard = true;

// You can initialize a variable with const (if it isn't going to change while you program runs)
// or with let if it will change.

// So we can initialize a variable with let...

let myTotal = 17.99; // 17.99

// and then update it later...

myTotal = myTotal + 4.99; // now it is 22.98
// we could have also written this as: myTotal += 4.99;
// (we just added an additional 4.99 to myTotal)

// We can also just re-declare it anything we want like:
myTotal = 128.97;
